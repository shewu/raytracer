IMPORTANT:
* commits should always be in the following format:
  
	STATUS; summary of changes

  Examples:

    WORKING; modified README
	QUESTTIONABLE; image is slightly darker
	NONWORKING; where did our global illumination go?!

* leave curly braces on their separate line and include them even if the 
  if-statement is one line long
* Make with NOCILK=1 if your machine does not have cilk
  * send email if you want the cilk programming guide

TODO:
* implement octree for irradiance cache
* change spherical coords in Photon struct to cartesian coords
